# Project 0

This website is part of my homework for the course Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. It shows pictures that I've taken in and around Boston, together with some info on the photographed locations. The website has a homepage and 3 pages dedicated to pictures, organized by location.

Folder "Images" contains the pictures used on the websites. "Style" contains css and sassy css files.
Index.html is the homepage and harvard.html, library.html and museum.html are the pages with pictures.
